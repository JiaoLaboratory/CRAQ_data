Detailed description: 

A.oxysepala_contig_draft.fa: The original draft FALCON contigs of A.oxysepala for CRAQ conducting.  

A.oxysepala_contig_CRAQcorrect.fa: The new generated A.oxysepala contigs after performing CRAQ correction.  

A.oxysepala_original.scaffold.hic.fa : The original scaffolds from the the draft contigs of A.oxysepala. 3D-DNA pipeline (without correction: -r 0) was performed for the De novo scaffolding process.  

A.oxysepala_corrected.scaffold.hic.fa：The new generated scaffolds from the the CRAQ-corrected contigs of A.oxysepala. 3D-DNA pipeline (without correction: -r 0) was performed for the De novo scaffolding process as above. 

HiC-contacts-for-original-scaffold: A folder that contains the temporary files, including the Hi-C interaction file (.hic), and the orientation and order information (.assembly) file for checking up the anchored draft contigs.

HiC-contacts-for-corrected-scaffold: A folder that contains temporary results, including the Hi-C interaction file (.hic), and the orientation and order information (.assembly) file for checking up the anchored CRAQ-corrected contigs. 

A.oxysepala_DLE-1_optical.cmap：The information of assembled Bionano optical maps for detecting and validating potentail problematic contigs. 

Raw_sequencing_Illumina_PacBio_HiC.link：An address that links all of the raw sequencing data used in this project, including the raw PacBio CLR long-reads, the Illumima PE-reads,and Hi-C data.
